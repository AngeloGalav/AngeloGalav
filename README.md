### Hi there 👋, I'm Angelo
And welcome to my GitHub profile!

#### About Me
- 🎓 I've obtained a BSc in Computer Science and a MSc in Artificial Intelligence, both at @ UniBo, and both with the maximum grade (110/110 with honours).
- 📚 I'm currently actively looking for a job, specifically for roles in AI Engineering and Sofware Engineering.
- 👨‍💻 In the meantime, I’m working on a lot of very different side projects. Let's see what works out...
- 💭 I'm interested in edge AI, Procedural Generation, Computer Graphics, VR and, in general, close-to-the-hardware development. 
- 😊 If you have questions on my projects, have an interesting idea/proposal, or just want to chat, please send me an email!

#### What you will find on this page
- Most of the projects I'm currently working on, and their code.
- Some of my university notes and studying material, as I believe knowledge should be available to everyone. 

#### What you won't find on this page
- My Unity projects, such as games or experiments with procedural generation. 
  - I've published some of them on [gamejolt](https://gamejolt.com/@unforeseen_creations) and [itch.io](https://unforeseen-creations.itch.io/). 
- My procedural artworks. You can find them on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/unforeseen_creations/). 
  - It's been a looong time since I've posted there tho...
